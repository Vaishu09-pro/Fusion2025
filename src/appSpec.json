The design will be dark, immersive, and dynamic, using vibrant accent colors to highlight key information and calls to action, mirroring the glow of code on a screen.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Full-Bleed Immersive Background: A dark, high-contrast background featuring subtle, animated circuit board patterns will envelop the entire site, creating an immediate sense of depth and technological immersion.\n2. Typographic Hierarchy as Data Flow: Text elements will be treated as data streams, with clear hierarchy and distinct styling for titles, subtitles, and body content, using bright, contrasting colors for emphasis.\n3. Dynamic Component Styling: Interactive elements like buttons and cards will adopt a futuristic aesthetic, potentially incorporating subtle glows or sharp, geometric shapes to align with the tech theme.\n4. Asymmetrical Layouts for Energy: While maintaining readability, layouts will lean towards asymmetrical arrangements and strategic use of negative space to convey dynamism and innovation, avoiding rigid, predictable structures.",

In these dark 'primary' zones, all typography should be rendered in the 'primaryForeground' color (the acid lime) to ensure maximum readability and visual vibration. The 'abstractShape' color is reserved for subtle background geometries or textural overlays that add depth without distracting from the content.

A central `div` for the main title 'FUSION' (`text-9xl font-bold text-cyan-500`). The subtitle '24 - HOUR HACKATHON' is positioned above it (`text-6xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mb-4`). A smaller 'PRESENTS' text is above that (`text-4xl font-bold text-orange-500 mb-2`). The background is a dark, animated circuit pattern.\nSignature Hook (Framer Motion Spec): The main 'FUSION' text uses `variants` for a staggered letter reveal. `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}` and `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}` with `transition: { staggerChildren: 0.05, delayChildren: 0.5 }`. Each letter `span` has a `motion.span` wrapper. The '24 - HOUR HACKATHON' subtitle has a subtle `whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, color: '#00FFFF' }}` effect."

    "designSummary": "**Digital Circuitry: A Dynamic Tech Canvas**\n\nThe Vision: This website will embody the electrifying energy of a 24-hour hackathon, translating the visual language of digital circuits and futuristic technology into a compelling online experience. The design will be dark, immersive, and dynamic, using vibrant accent colors to highlight key information and calls to action, mirroring the glow of code on a screen.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Full-Bleed Immersive Background: A dark, high-contrast background featuring subtle, animated circuit board patterns will envelop the entire site, creating an immediate sense of depth and technological immersion.\n2. Typographic Hierarchy as Data Flow: Text elements will be treated as data streams, with clear hierarchy and distinct styling for titles, subtitles, and body content, using bright, contrasting colors for emphasis.\n3. Dynamic Component Styling: Interactive elements like buttons and cards will adopt a futuristic aesthetic, potentially incorporating subtle glows or sharp, geometric shapes to align with the tech theme.\n4. Asymmetrical Layouts for Energy: While maintaining readability, layouts will lean towards asymmetrical arrangements and strategic use of negative space to convey dynamism and innovation, avoiding rigid, predictable structures.",

Secondary elements and supporting text use a bright orange (#FF8C00). Accent colors like red (#FF4500) can be used sparingly for alerts or special highlights. Ensure high contrast for all text elements against their backgrounds.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "Ensure all text elements have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their background for WCAG AA compliance. The primary cyan (#00FFFF) and orange (#FF8C00) are chosen for their vibrancy and contrast against the dark background. Use the foreground color (#E0E0E0) for general body text to maintain readability."
